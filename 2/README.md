# FMN011 Project 2 - Finding the line strength of stars for an astronomer
A project in the course [FMN011](http://www.maths.lth.se/na/courses/FMN011/) Numerical Analysis for Computer Scientists at Lund University 2012. This project is about solving real-world problems with their accompanied complexities and ambiguities. The best method must be determined and its limitations and possible errors must be known. In this project intensity of light from stars will be studied.

For more details on the tasks see the instructions in [doc/](https://github.com/erikw/fmn011_projects/tree/master/2/doc) where my report with the results resides.
