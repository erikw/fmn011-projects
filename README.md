# FMN011 Project 1 - Solving huge systems of equations
A project in the course [FMN011](http://www.maths.lth.se/na/courses/FMN011/) Numerical Analysis for Computer Scientists at Lund University 2012. This project is about solving systems of very huge matrices. More specifically the matrices are not only huge but also almost banded and sparse which have important consequences and applications. The tasks are implemented using MATLAB.

For more details on the tasks see the instructions in [doc/](https://github.com/erikw/fmn011_project1/tree/master/doc) where my report with the results resides.
